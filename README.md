ashwin_srinivas_PS4.ipynb --> Python notebook file that contains the complete analysis


spam.csv --> dataset with messages and labels for each message


Final Report.pdf --> Report that contains the evaluation results of various models to choose the best performing one

This project implements multiple ML algorithms such as Naive Bayes, KNN and Decision Trees in order to classify messages as spam or not spam (ham).
Various NLP techniques have been implemented for cleaning messy texts, feature extraction, spam classification, etc. 
The models mentioned above have been evaluated by comparing various metircs such as specificity, sensitivity, etc. to determine which model gives the best results.
